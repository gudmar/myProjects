
About Story Dices

For one of online gatherings of Toastmasters, I prepared a electronic version of story telling game, where user throws dices, and tells a story related to drawn images.
In this game it is guaranteed that images will not repete. User may redraw an image that is not comfortable by clicking a specific cube, or redraw all images with rewind button.
After clicking a burger button user may select topics player feels comfortable with, or number of cubes that will be displayed.
There is a menu for reminding Toastmasters Table Topic rules, and informing that a story should have a structure. 

This application is designed to look good on all types of devices. Especially mobile devices are importan, as someone may want to practic story telling having only a smartphone.

What is used?

This application is constructed mainly in pure JavaScript. Gulp was used to build it to a single file.
For styling pure CSS, and HTML for loading pages.
Application uses custom web elements for encapsulation an reusebility.
